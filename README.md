# On-chain dice roll game written with Anchor Framework

This program doesn't have a frontend, it only has unit tests.

You can run "anchor deploy" after cloning the repository.

### Future improvements:

1. Randomization is weak. It needs be better.
2. Program needs to be tested on devnet with a well written frontend by using phantom wallet.
